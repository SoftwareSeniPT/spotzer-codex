## Website Design

### Set up the Canvas

Let's begin by creating a new Photoshop document by selecting File > New.
Set the canvas Width to 1366px, Height to 1200px(depend the design), Resolution to 72, and the Background Contents to White.

### Create Guideline

Next, we need to create two guides that will act as the container for our page.
Select View > New Guide...
For the first guide, set the Orientation to Vertical and the Position to 203 px.

For the second guide, select View > New Guide... again and create another Vertical guide with the Position set to 1163 px.

### Organize Layers

Organizing your website mockups is very, very important. You'll find yourself creating tons and tons of layers, so you want to keep naming those layers and grouping them together as frequently as possible. The more effort you put into organizing your layers, the easier it will be to navigate through your design later. This is especially helpful to developers who may be getting your designs later on.

### Website Layout

No matter how unique the design, almost all websites adhere to a general layout for ease of use. Though they vary slightly, each layout consists of five key items that exist on every page of your website.

Items on every page:
- Header
- Hero Image
- Content
- Sidebar
- Footer

People expect to be able to find these items with ease, which is why it's important to select the layout that works best with your website. Of the many possible ways to layout a website, below are six different examples: 

![layout](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15760221/11083869/3e2f7d1c-87e9-11e5-99aa-57adc6fea8f8.png)

### Website Typography

Reading is a complex activity. Readers use both their foveal (central) vision and their peripheral vision to process more than one word at a time; they fixate on certain words while filling in the rest. Readers scan across lines of text while also scanning down the text, either to the next line or the next paragraph. Readable text promotes both horizontal and vertical scanning; readability is a function of multiple things, including size, line height, line length (measure), and alignment.

#### Size

If type is too small, it loses legibility. The shapes of letters (both the strokes and spaces) are less pronounced at small sizes. Readers have to slow down to recognize individual letters or word shapes. It is difficult to process more than one word at a time if text is too small.

If type is too large, it undermines the horizontal flow of the text. Large words take up more space in our foveal vision, making it difficult for readers to process more than one word at a time.

I recommend setting text type at 14 to 16px. Fonts with a large x-height look bigger and will work fine at 14 to 15px. Fonts with a small x-height look smaller, and need to be set at 15 to 16px. I rarely set large amounts of text at 13px or smaller; it’s harder to read.

#### Line Height

Line height controls the amount of space between lines of text. The lines of text should feel like horizontal lines, not like a tightly woven fabric.

Readers scan both horizontally and vertically, and if the line height is too tight, it undermines the horizontal flow of the text; readers will find themselves scanning down the text, even when they don’t want to.

If the line height is too loose, the lines of text start to “float away” from each other. They no longer feel like a cohesive unit of text, and vertical scanning becomes more difficult.

A good rule of thumb is to set your line height at approximately 145-150% of your text size. For example, 14px text often works well at a 21px (150%) line height, 15px text often works well at a 22px (146%) line height, and so on. Every font is different, but 145-150% is a good place to start.

#### Measure (Line Length)

Long lines of text are harder to read because they force readers to change their eye movement. Readers want to scan across and down the text at the same time, focusing on a couple of words and filling in the rest. When lines of text are long, readers need to work harder to scan across an entire line, then go back and find the start of the next line.
Measure of text

Short lines can make text feel chopped up, causing a reader’s scanning to become more vertical than horizontal. Short lines break up the intended rhythm of a text meant for sustained reading. In addition, short lines can undermine the shape of a text block, creating extremely ragged edges on one side of the text, or creating large white spaces in justified text. Use short lines for captions and lists.

#### Alignment

There are five ways to align text: left aligned, right aligned, centered, justified, and asymmetrical. Each method has pros and cons related to ease of reading and formal beauty and integrity.

Right aligned, centered, and asymmetrical text is more difficult to read. The starting point for each line varies. Readers have to find the start of each line, which undermines vertical scanning.

Left aligned and justified text is easier to read because each line starts at the same place. Readers do not have to find the start of each line, which promotes vertical scanning.

## Tips and Trick

### Using 960 Grid System

960 Grid System is a transparent grid which you use to keep your boxes aligned and even in photoshop. The 960gs comes in 12, 16, and 24 column versions.

**Step 1: Download 960gs**

Download 960gs package [Here](https://github.com/nathansmith/960-Grid-System/archive/master.zip). This download will come with templates for all kinds of software, all we will really need is the photoshop ones.

**Step 2: Open in Photoshop**

Open up the download and go the photoshop directory (templates>photoshop/). In the photoshop folder you will find the 3 templates (12, 16, and 24).

![open](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15760221/11113732/116af1da-88d4-11e5-91f3-8d37d8b955e0.png)

The 12 column template is best fitted for simple layouts, and the 24 column is for complex layouts. Open the template in photoshop. The layers window will look like this:

**Step 3: New Document**

Now open a fresh document for your layout (1366×1000). Now switch back to the 960 template and drag and drop the “16 col grid” layer to your new layout. Center the “16 col grid” vertically and horizontally.

**How do I design with it?**

That’s it, your all set up. To use it, you simply leave the grid overlaying everything else, and align elements of your layout to it. Here’s and example (taken from 960.gs):
