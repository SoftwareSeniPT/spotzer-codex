## Introduction

This Codex is a living document that will be updated as we continue to develop the tenets and specifics of SoftwareSeni best practice. The goal is to develop a single underlying system that allows for unified best practice across projects and educate ourselves by learning from the experience. 

SS Codex is an open project for SS, meaning you can directly impact its evolution by filing issues and submitting pull requests. This is as much your tool as it is ours, and we look forward to collaborating with staff and partners on making it even better.

## Principles
1. We learn from the root. Not abstraction. Javascript before jQUery. CSS before Bootstrap. PHP before Wordpress. 
2. We acknowledge that performance is critical.
