## Introduction
### What we invoice to client:
* New site
  * This is added to the invoice on the first site draft delivery. We call it (LINK)
* Full time resources
  * If staff is requested for specific work, outside In production work.
* Add-ons
  * Based on Quote request from Client. Using this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hEBwBKLb-iD5bb2z0GqFmUXoR1-Ot4iTf7A5-lZKdmI/edit#gid=0">Form</a>
  * It could be also extra work for a project in Production
* Adjustments to Live Sites

* Hosting / Migration
    * If a site is hosted on one of our server, we start charging them from the moment the A Record redirection is done.
    * Migration is an action of moving one site from a server to another.

### The process for Invoices are:

<div class="note">When a site is “linked” to the client (first draft delivered to client)</div>

* SDM/PM will then add the project to the Invoice Document for the actual month of delivery. A New Billing document will be created for each month.
* Only specific Manager in SoftwareSeni is allowed to edit, as it has complex scripting.

* SDM/PM can update it later, if any new work is done within the same month, otherwise, it will be added on the next month as an Add-ons.

* The Accountant will then send the Billing Invoice before the 5th of the next month.
