## The process for billing Invoices

* When a project is "link", and sent to client, SDM/PM will then add the project to the Billing Invoice Document for the actual month of delivery. A New Billing document will be created for each month.
* Only specific Manager in SoftwareSeni is allowed to edit, as it has complex scripting.

* SDM/PM can update it later, if any new work is done within the same month, otherwise, it will be added on the next month as an Add-ons.

* The Accountant will then send the Billing Invoice before the 5th of the next month.
